## Introduction
Welcome to the Hangman game! This is a simple text-based game written in Python.

## Game Play
The game selects a word at random from the following list: "ardvark", "baboon", "camel". Your task is to guess the word one letter at a time. 

## Rules

You start the game with 6 lives. The game ends when you have guessed the word correctly or when you have no lives left.

## Game Stages
The game has several stages representing the hangman, which change as you lose lives.
