# Treasure Island Game

This is a simple text-based game called "Treasure Island". The game prompts the player with a series of choices and challenges as they navigate through different scenarios in order to find the treasure.

## Game Instructions

2. Follow the instructions displayed in the console.
3. Make choices by typing the appropriate keywords provided.
4. Continue making choices until you either find the treasure and win the game or encounter a game-ending scenario.

## Gameplay Overview

The game starts with a welcome message and the mission to find the treasure. The player is then presented with a series of choices and must decide which path to take by typing their choice in the console.

The game flow is as follows:

1. The player is at a crossroad and must choose between going left or right.
2. If the player chooses to go left, they arrive at a lake and must decide whether to wait for a boat or swim across.
3. If the player chooses to wait for a boat, they safely arrive at the island and are faced with a house containing three doors: red, yellow, and blue.
4. The player must select a door color and depending on their choice, they may either find the treasure and win the game or encounter a game-over scenario.
5. If the player chooses to swim across the lake instead of waiting for a boat, they get attacked by an angry trout and the game ends.
6. If the player initially chooses to go right at the crossroad, they fall into a hole and the game ends.


## Game Over Scenarios

There are three game-over scenarios in the game:

1. If the player chooses the red door at the house, they enter a room full of fire and the game ends.
2. If the player chooses the blue door at the house, they enter a room of beasts and the game ends.
3. If the player chooses to swim across the lake instead of waiting for a boat, they get attacked by an angry trout and the game ends.

## Notes

The game is implemented using Python and runs in the console. It demonstrates basic conditional statements and user input handling.
