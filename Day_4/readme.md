# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple Python code for playing the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The user can choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors by inputting the corresponding number.

## How to Play

1. The user should run the program.
2. The program will prompt the user to enter their choice by typing a number:
   - 0 for Rock
   - 1 for Paper
   - 2 for Scissors
3. After the user makes a valid selection, the program will display the chosen hand symbol.
4. The program will randomly generate a choice for the computer and display the computer's hand symbol.
5. The program will determine the winner based on the following rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
6. The program will display the result, whether the user wins, loses, or if it's a draw.

Note: If the user enters an invalid number (less than 0 or greater than 2), an error message will be displayed.

## Example Usage
