## Customization

If you wish to customize the character sets used for generating passwords, you can modify the following variables in the script:

- `letters`: Contains a list of letters (both lowercase and uppercase).
- `symbols`: Contains a list of symbols.
- `numbers`: Contains a list of numbers.

Feel free to add or remove characters from these lists to suit your needs.

## Security Considerations

- It is important to note that while this script generates random passwords, it does not take into account specific password strength requirements or enforce any password policies. It is always recommended to use longer passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers to enhance security.

- Ensure that you use the generated passwords responsibly and avoid sharing them with others or storing them in an insecure manner.
