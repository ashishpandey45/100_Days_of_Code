# 100 Days of Code - Python Projects

This repository documents my journey of the "100 Days of Code" challenge, where I commit to coding every single day for 100 days and create a project using Python.

## Motivation

The purpose of this challenge is to enhance my programming skills, reinforce my knowledge of Python, and develop the habit of consistent coding practice. By dedicating time every day to work on projects, I aim to improve my problem-solving abilities, expand my programming repertoire, and gain hands-on experience in various areas of Python development.

## Project Structure

Each day, I will create a new project or work on an existing one, focusing on different aspects of Python programming. The projects can range from small scripts to more complex applications, covering a wide range of topics such as web scraping, data analysis, automation, GUI development, and more.

The projects will be organized in the following structure:

Each project directory will contain the Python script(s) for that particular day's project and a `README.md` file documenting the project's details, including its purpose, functionality, and any relevant instructions or notes.

## Project Ideas and Inspiration

To keep myself motivated and to explore different aspects of Python programming, I will gather project ideas and inspiration from various sources, including online tutorials, books, coding challenges, and personal interests. I will also seek suggestions from the coding community and encourage others to contribute project ideas or collaborate on specific days.

## Progress Tracking

I will update the `README.md` file of each project with a brief summary of what I accomplished, learned, and any challenges faced during the development. Additionally, I will maintain a daily log or journal to record my progress, insights, and reflections on the overall experience.
